 + homepage: mostly a giant map. we'll work on that later. there will be a transparent banner across the top that reads, "Welcome to the SWISLR Seek Platform". the subtitle under that will say, "A platform for connecting scholars and experts interested in saltwater intrusion and sea level rise". there will be four white buttons arranged vertically on the left side of the page, also superimposed on the map. in order, these are labelled, "Seeking collaborators?", "Seeking data?", "Seeking publications?", "Stories from the field".
 + each of these buttons will connect to a separate page, and each of these separate pages will include a view into the database for the corresponding topic. page contents will be filterable by keyword, etc
 + this website requires user management and authentication. it's only for academic researchers, so we'll need some way to verify people signing up. 
 + we'll need a way to email members annually and ask them questions like: anything to add to your profile? Any new papers or datasets to share? Any war stories? Any new SWISLRs we should invite to join us? Want to contribute to SWISLR endowment?
 + users must be able to upload their own stories, publications, datasets, and other users they think might like to join
 + uploaded data do not need to be harmonized, but they do need to be characterized. at the most basic level, data will be grouped into field data, remote sensing data, models and model output. users uploading data will be prompted to specify this categorization as well as other tags and metadata
 + when querying data, users should see their selections appearing on the map. I'm hoping we can integrate with some other service to allow this. NASA's earthdata has a search tool that is perfect for this job, but I don't know if it can be borrowed or integrated in any way
