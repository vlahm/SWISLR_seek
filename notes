DOCKER/COMPOSER COMMANDS:

docker-compose stop      # Pauses containers (they still exist), use that end of day if necessary
docker-compose start     # Resumes them
docker-compose restart

docker-compose down           # Stops and removes containers, stops the network, database and data persist
docker-compose down -v        # Also removes volumes, use for a fresh start
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up 		# use this in dev. composer specs are split because we don't want to use too many bind mounts in prod
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d									# use this in prod
note that on prod there's a third container for the Caddy
docker-compose up --build -d  # Starts or resumes your containers and builds Dockerfile
docker-compose up -d	      # Starts or resumes your containers
docker-compose build --no-cache drupal 									# eventually you'll want to rebuild the container locally. need to ignore cache for that, so up -d will fail

docker ps				list running containers (and get their names)
docker cp container_id:path local_path		copy contents to/from container
docker cp b1a5a7c9b1b8:/opt/drupal/web/sites/default/files/config_gCohTr204_tUOHEoCSoqQdwbSTu87xtRCQZHJalG7RX3qSVKy3vy5Se3bI1B9pRplYijH-tFCA/sync backup/

docker exec -it drupal-platform_drupal_1  bash		enter the container
docker exec -it drupal-platform_db_1  bash		enter the database container?


INSIDE THE CONTAINER:

docker exec or composer		Use commands inside the running container, update code or modules

#must run these from project root (on container)! that's where composer.json is found.
composer require drupal/group
composer require drupal/bootstrap5


PRE-DEPLOY:

# test build
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache drupal
composer require drush/drush
. post_install_steps.sh
drush cr

# build a lockfile from package versions specified in composer.json (run locally!)
	composer update/install --no-interaction (update may change versions, so prefer install)
	gitignore vendor/ and web/
	commit .gitattributes, .editorconfig, and composer.lock
to do this you will need to install composer on local machine:
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install -y php-cli unzip curl
	curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer -o composer-setup.php
	sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
	rm composer-setup.php
	composer --version
if you get an error about missing PHP extensions, install with e.g.:
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install -y php8.3-xml php8.3-curl
	sudo apt install -y php8.3-zip php8.3-mbstring php8.3-gd php8.3-intl php8.3-mysql


BACKUPS:

# (Use maintenance mode when upgrading, importing or exporting content, modifying a theme, modifying content types, and making backups.)
# eventually you'll want to rebuild the container locally. need to ignore cache for that, so up -d will fail
# need this: apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends mariadb-client
#	but don't need it for production

drush sset system.maintenance_mode 1
drush archive:dump --destination=/var/www/html/modules/custom/backup.tar.gz  --exclude-code-paths=web/sites/default/settings.php
drush sset system.maintenance_mode 0
	follow this with e.g.: mv modules/custom/backup.tar.gz backup2.tar.gz
	backup files and database, excluding the settings file which contains secrets.
	can put secrets in settings.local.php, but whatevs
	for regular-basis backups during development, sql:dump is probs fine


CONTRIB UPDATES (backup first):

when GUI updating fails:
drush sset system.maintenance_mode 1
e.g.:
	composer update drupal/bootstrap5 --with-all-dependencies
OR (esp. if that fails [due to fixed version?]):
	composer require drupal/bootstrap5:^5.3 --with-all-dependencies
drush updb -y
might need: drush cron
might need: drush ev 'Drupal::service("update.manager")->refreshUpdateData();'
drush cr
drush sset system.maintenance_mode 0


CORE UPDATES (clear all errors and backup first):

drush sset system.maintenance_mode 1
TRY: composer update "drupal/core-*" --with-all-dependencies
IF IT FAILS, it's probaby because you've fixed the version? so use require: 
composer require \
  drupal/core-recommended:^10.5 \
  drupal/core-composer-scaffold:^10.5 \
  drupal/core-project-message:^10.5 \
  --with-all-dependencies
drush updb -y
drush cron
drush ev 'Drupal::service("update.manager")->refreshUpdateData();'
drush cr
drush sset system.maintenance_mode 0


OTHER

drush en <module>				enable module (-y flag if desired)
drush pm:uninstall <module>		always run this before removing module files!
drush wd-show					logs
drush pm:list --status=enabled --type=module


DEPLOY

start with hax/servers/server_setup.txt
then clone repo. 
recreate .env

might have to change docker-compose.yaml to accept traffic on port 80
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw status

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER #(log out and back in)
docker-compose up -d db
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml build --no-cache drupal
docker-compose up -d drupal
docker-compose up -d caddy

docker exec -it swislr_seek_drupal_1  bash #(e.g.)
composer require drush/drush #(supposedly shouldn't need this, becuase drush is already included)

if you have to change anything in the docker-compose.yaml, you'll probably have to wade through all this insane shit:
docker-compose stop drupal
docker-compose rm -f drupal
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans drupal
(this will fail)
docker images | awk '/drupal|swislr/ {print $3}' | xargs -r docker rmi
(this will totally fail)
docker-compose up -d --build drupal
(but then this will still work)

visit seek.swislr.org for database setup. copy names/pws from .env.
database host is the name of the database service as specified in docker-compose.yaml. in this case "db"

site name: SWISLR Seek
site email: mail@swislr.org
admin name: swislradmin

gotta add something like this to web/sites/default/settings.php: (why not automated?)
$settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = [
  '^seek\.swislr\.org$',
  '^localhost$',
  '^127\.0\.0\.1$',
];

. post_install_steps.sh

copy over config files, e.g.:
docker cp backup/sync/ b1a5a7c9b1b8:/opt/drupal/web/sites/default/files/config_gCohTr204_tUOHEoCSoqQdwbSTu87xtRCQZHJalG7RX3qSVKy3vy5Se3bI1B9pRplYijH-tFCA/

now, in sync/ on the container:
grep '^uuid:' system.site.yml #copy the resulting uuid and use it in the next step
drush cset system.site uuid "<that uuid>" -y

add to pathautho.pattern.story.yml: (though this will break local version), because that entity doesn't exist locally
id: story
label: 'Story URL pattern'
type: 'canonical_entities:node'


---------------- BUILD STEPS NOW AUTOMATED -----------------

add to /var/www/html/sites/default/settings.php:
$settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = [
  '^localhost$',
  '^127\.0\.0\.1$',
  '^swislr\.org$',
  '^www\.swislr\.org$',
];

----- TO DO ----------
composer require --dev drush/drush
run the post install script
might need to change ownership for all the files that are bind mounted

when development is complete, copy composer.lock into the repo and version control it. ensure that it gets copied onto the container during build. it will lock dependencies


----- TIPS ----------

if i'm ever going to develop themes or modules, do so outside the container, then mount from within
volumes:
  - ./themes:/var/www/html/themes
  - ./modules:/var/www/html/modules

is this contradictory? To develop themes or modules, mount them directly from your host machine instead of named volumes.
For production, consider replacing `volumes:` with bind mounts and add HTTPS, caching (e.g., Varnish), and backup mechanisms.

in dockerfile, build custom modules/themes (or anything that will change frequently) last.
that way, the system can cache the earlier steps and build will be faster


---- DIRECTORY ------------
drupal home for my first build was /opt/drupal/web (and i think the dir "drupal" was specified by me?)
alongside this home ("web") folder are vendor/, composer.json, and composer.lock

1. core/
    Contains built-in themes, modules, routing, and services
    Leave this untouched; update it via Composer when needed
2. modules/
	modules/contrib/ → For downloaded modules (e.g., Group, Webform)
	modules/custom/ → For modules you write yourself
    These folders don’t exist by default, but you can create them.
3. themes/
	themes/contrib/ → Downloaded themes
	themes/custom/ → Custom themes you create
	Start with something like Classy, Bootstrap 5, or Olivero
		Extend it as a subtheme
	find themes here: https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme
	install like so: composer require drupal/bootstrap5
4. sites/default/
        settings.php: site config (DB, trusted hosts, etc.)
        services.yml: service overrides (e.g., Twig debugging)
        files/: uploaded user content
    You can have multi-site setups, each under sites/example.com/, but default is typical
5. profiles/
    Installation profiles (like pre-built site templates)
    Ignore this unless you're distributing your own "starter kit"




-------- modules

find modules here
	https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module
