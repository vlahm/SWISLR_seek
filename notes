------ DOCKER/COMPOSER COMMANDS -------

docker-compose stop      # Pauses containers (they still exist), use that end of day
docker-compose start     # Resumes them
docker-compose restart

docker-compose down           # Stops and removes containers, stops the network, database and data persist
docker-compose down -v        # Also removes volumes, use for a fresh start
docker-compose up --build -d  # Starts or resumes your containers and builds Dockerfile
docker-compose up -d	      # Starts or resumes your containers

docker ps				list running containers (and get their names)
docker cp container_id:path local_path		copy contents to/from container

docker exec -it drupal-platform_drupal_1  bash		enter the container
docker exec -it drupal-platform_db_1  bash		enter the database container?

docker exec or composer		Use commands inside the running container, update code or modules

composer require drupal/group
composer require drupal/bootstrap5

good to enter maintenance mode before doing these:
	(or these: Use maintenance mode when making major updates, particularly if the updates could disrupt visitors or the update process. Examples include upgrading, importing or exporting content, modifying a theme, modifying content types, and making backups.)

drush archive:dump --destination=/var/www/html/modules/custom/backup.tar.gz  --exclude-code-paths=web/sites/default/settings.php
	backup files and database, excluding the settings file which contains secrets.
	can put secrets in settings.local.php, but whatevs

composer update "drupal/core-*" --with-all-dependencies
	update core, but first recommended to clear all errors and run backup
	then run: drush updatedb
	then drush cr

----- TO DO ----------
composer require --dev drush/drush
run the post install script
might need to change ownership for all the files that are bind mounted

when development is complete, copy composer.lock into the repo and version control it. ensure that it gets copied onto the container during build. it will lock dependencies


----- TIPS ----------

if i'm ever going to develop themes or modules, do so outside the container, then mount from within
volumes:
  - ./themes:/var/www/html/themes
  - ./modules:/var/www/html/modules

is this contradictory? To develop themes or modules, mount them directly from your host machine instead of named volumes.
For production, consider replacing `volumes:` with bind mounts and add HTTPS, caching (e.g., Varnish), and backup mechanisms.

in dockerfile, build custom modules/themes (or anything that will change frequently) last.
that way, the system can cache the earlier steps and build will be faster


---- DIRECTORY ------------
drupal home for my first build was /opt/drupal/web (and i think the dir "drupal" was specified by me?)
alongside this home ("web") folder are vendor/, composer.json, and composer.lock

1. core/
    Contains built-in themes, modules, routing, and services
    Leave this untouched; update it via Composer when needed
2. modules/
	modules/contrib/ → For downloaded modules (e.g., Group, Webform)
	modules/custom/ → For modules you write yourself
    These folders don’t exist by default, but you can create them.
3. themes/
	themes/contrib/ → Downloaded themes
	themes/custom/ → Custom themes you create
	Start with something like Classy, Bootstrap 5, or Olivero
		Extend it as a subtheme
	find themes here: https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme
	install like so: composer require drupal/bootstrap5
4. sites/default/
        settings.php: site config (DB, trusted hosts, etc.)
        services.yml: service overrides (e.g., Twig debugging)
        files/: uploaded user content
    You can have multi-site setups, each under sites/example.com/, but default is typical
5. profiles/
    Installation profiles (like pre-built site templates)
    Ignore this unless you're distributing your own "starter kit"




-------- modules

find modules here
	https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module

	composer require drupal/group
